# LANL Earthquake Prediction from Kaggle

## Introduction
Repository for the SlimBros team for the DLANL Earthquake Prediction challenge from Kaggle (May2019 to June2019). In this competition, the goal is to predict when the earthquake will take place. Specifically, to predict the time remaining before laboratory earthquakes occur from real-time seismic data.

## Quickstart
 1 - Download the repo:
 ```
 $ git clone git@github.com:ricarddelgado/lanl-earthquake-kaggle.git
 ```
 2 - Create and activate your favourite virtual environment and install python requirements
```
$ conda create -n lanl python=3.7
$ conda activate lanl
$ (lanl) pip install -r requirements.txt
```
